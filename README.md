## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based,
- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous.
- Jetpack Compose
- Compose Navigation
- ViewModel: Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
- Room Database: Constructs Database by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access.
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection.
- Clean Architecture
- MVVM Architecture 
- Repository Pattern
