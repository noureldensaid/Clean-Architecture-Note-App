â€¢ Developed a native Android mobile app using (Kotlin).
â€¢ The application addresses the challenge of finding suitable workspaces by providing users with detailed information about the
nearest and highly-rated options that meet their specific needs.
â€¢ Effectively organized and managed the workspace booking process for a seamless user experience.
â€¢ Utilized GPS technology to suggest the closest workspaces based on user location.
â€¢ Showcased amenities and real images of workspaces to build user trust and enable informed decision-making.
â€¢ Optimized usersâ€™ time and reduced costs by avoiding overcrowded workspaces.
â€¢ Facilitated reservations and increased bookings for lesser-known workspaces.
â€¢ Streamlined the booking process and implemented efficient room management capabilities for workspace owners.
â€¢ Used technologies: MVVM, LiveData, View Binding, Navigation Component, Kotlin Coroutines, Kotlin Flows, Retrofit2, Dagger Hilt,
Room Database, Datastore Preferences, User Location, Media Permissions and Glide.

## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based,
- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous.
- Jetpack Compose
- Compose Navigation
- ViewModel: Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
- Room Database: Constructs Database by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access.
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection.
- Clean Architecture
- MVVM Architecture 
- Repository Pattern
